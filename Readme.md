📌 Project Overview

This project is a React-based Todo application built as a Proof of Concept to apply core React concepts in a practical scenario. The goal was to move beyond tutorials and implement a complete, structured application from scratch.
The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It includes multi-page navigation using client-side routing, a dedicated progress tracking page, and interactive UI enhancements such as alerts and a confetti animation when all tasks are completed.
The project focuses on component structure, state management, props handling, routing, conditional rendering, and overall application architecture.
